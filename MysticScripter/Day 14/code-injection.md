# Code Injection

Code injection, also called Remote Code Execution (RCE), occurs when an attacker exploits an input validation flaw in software to introduce and execute malicious code. Code is injected in the language of the targeted application and executed by the server-side interpreter. Any application that directly uses unvalidated input is vulnerable to code injection, and web applications are a prime target for attackers. This article shows how code injection vulnerabilities arise and how you can protect your web applications from injection.
