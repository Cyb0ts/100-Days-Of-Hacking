# HTML Injection

HTML Injection is a vulnerability which occurs in web applications that allows users to insert
HTML code via a specific parameter or an entry point.

It is generally exploited using social engineering in order to trick valid users of the application to
open malicious websites or to insert the credentials in a fake login form that will redirect the
users to a page that captures cookies or credentials.
